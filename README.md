## System 47

This is Ver. 2.2 of the great System47 screen saver from [mewho.com](http://mewho.com/system47/) converted to HTML5 with the now defunct [Google Swiffy](https://developers.google.com/swiffy/).

System 47 can be run as a web page or as a mobile app on phones and tables. There are both audio and no audio versions of the screen saver. Please note that audio doesn't currently work on iOS. This seems to be a problem with the Swiffy runtime from Google.
